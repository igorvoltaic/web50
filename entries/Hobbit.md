# Hobbit

Hobbits or Halflings are a fictional human-like race in the novels of J. R. R. Tolkien, about half the height of humans. They live barefooted, and live in underground houses which have windows, as they are typically built into the sides of hills. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit)
