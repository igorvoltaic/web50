# CSS

Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like [HTML](/wiki/HTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside [HTML](/wiki/HTML) and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
